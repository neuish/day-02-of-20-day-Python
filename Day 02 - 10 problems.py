#1. Write a program that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
def number_checker():
    number = int(input('enter a positive or a negative number or a zero:'))

    if number == 0: 
        print(f'{number} is a 0')

    elif number > 0 :
        print(f'{number} is a positive number')

    elif number < 0 :
        print(f'{number} is a negative number')

#2. Create a program that checks whether a year is a leap year.

def leap_year():
    year = int(input('enter a year to check its leap year:'))

    if (year % 4 == 0) and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 ==0):
        print(f'{year} is a leap year')
    else:
        print(f'{year}is not a leap year')

#3. Write a program that asks the user for their age and prints whether they can vote.

def vote_rights():
    age = int(input('enter your age:'))

    if age >= 18 :
        print('you can vote')
    else:
        print('you dont yet have the voting rights')

#4. Write a program that grades a student based on their marks.
def grade():
    grade = float(input('enter your grade:'))

    if grade < 35 : print('fail')
    elif grade < 50 : print('3rd division')
    elif grade < 60 : print('second division')
    elif grade < 80 : print('first Division')
    else: print('distinction')

#5. Modify the discount calculator to implement tiered pricing. For example, if the price is below $50, apply a 5% discount, if between $50 and $100, apply a 10% discount, and if above $100, apply a 20% discount.
def discount_Calc():
    price = float(input('enter the price:'))

    if price < 50: 
        discount = price * 0.05
        print(f'the discounted price is {discount}')
        
    elif 50 <= price <= 100:
        discount = price * 0.10

    elif price > 100: 
        discount = price * 0.30
        print(f'the discounted price is {discount}')

#6. Create a program that simulates a login system by asking the user for a username and password. Print "Access granted" if the username and password match predefined values; otherwise, print "Access denied."
def login_system():
    defined_username = 'username'
    defined_password = 'pass1234@@'

    username = input ('enter the username:')
    password = input ('enter the password:')

    if username == defined_username and password == defined_password: print('access granted')
    else: print('invalid username and password')

#7. Write a program that calculates the income tax based on a progressive tax system. Define tax brackets (e.g., 10% for income up to $50,000, 20% for income between $50,001 and $100,000, and 30% for income above $100,000) and compute the tax for any given income.
def income_tax():
    income = float(input('enter your income'))

    if income <= 50000:
        tax = income * 0.10
        print(f'the tax for the given {income} is {tax}')
       
    if 50001 <= income <= 100000:
        tax = income * 0.20
        print(f'the tax for the given {income} is {tax}')

    if income > 100000:
        tax = income * 0.30
        print(f'the tax for the given {income} is {tax}')

#8. Write a program that solves a quadratic equation (axÂ² + bx + c = 0) using the quadratic formula. Handle cases where the discriminant is negative, zero, or positive and print the appropriate solution(s).
import math
import cmath
def quadratic_eq():
    a, b, c = map(int, input('enter the value for a, b, and c saperated by a space').split())
    D = pow(b, 2) - (4*a*c)

    if D > 0:
    # Two real roots
        root1 = (-b + math.sqrt(D)) / (2 * a)
        root2 = (-b - math.sqrt(D)) / (2 * a)
        print(f"The equation has two real roots: {root1} and {root2}")
    
    elif D == 0:
    # One real root
        root = -b / (2 * a)
        print(f"The equation has one real root: {root}")
    
    else:
    # Two complex roots
        root1 = (-b + cmath.sqrt(D)) / (2 * a)
        root2 = (-b - cmath.sqrt(D)) / (2 * a)
        print(f"The equation has two complex roots: {root1} and {root2}")
